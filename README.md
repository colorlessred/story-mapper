# Story Mapper

Simple Story Mapping tool.

Desired features
- Web UI to handle creation, move, and editing of stories
- simple db-less backend to store whole map in JSON, to allow for easy storing in project files

There are two modules
- ui: the web application
- server: the server that stored and retrieves the story map (as JSON file)
